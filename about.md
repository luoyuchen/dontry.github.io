>“怕什么真理无穷，进一寸有一寸的欢喜” ——胡适

I spent a few days to set up this blog. It’s very challenging and interesting. I’ve learned front-end developing for half a year. At first, I had a lot of fun from it. Because you just need type some code and the magic happens. However, when I delve into it, it’s not as easy as it seems. On the contrary, it’s very complex. Many skills are intertwined like HTML, CSS, JS, Photoshop, and some back-end skills. So it became intimidating. I have no idea how much I should learn in order to be a qualified front-end developer. I became very confused. But later I came across the quotation as I write at the start. I realized that learning is a lifetime process. As long as you could get a joy from it. It is still worthwhile. I will be always keeping in mind.

##Introduction of GitHub Pages:

Github pages is a free website based on GitHub repository. Unlike Wordpress, You barely consider any back-end stuffs. It’s very convenient to set up only if you know how to use GitHub. Many people use it as a personal blog site with Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. GitHub Pages and Jekyll are like peanut butter and jelly. What a perfect match!
