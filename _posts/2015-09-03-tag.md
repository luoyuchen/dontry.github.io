Because Jekyll doesn't fully support tagging feature. I learned how to feature tags into my blogs. I found  several ways. Fianlly I made it work by following the guides given by [MIDDUST](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/). This method need no plugin but you have to  generate a separate page everytime you create a new tag.  So it's like a work-around method.

Here are other methods may help:

 *   [Tags In Jekyll by Charlie Park(using Rugy plugin)](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)
 *   [A method similar to MIDDUST](An easy way to support tags in a jekyll blog)
 *   [A method using JSON](http://segmentfault.com/a/1190000000406017)
