### Setting up Paginator and Comment Module

Today I set up the paginator[[1](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/),[2](http://www.ericlagergren.com/blog/jekyll-pagination/)] and comment[[3](http://duoshuo.com/)] module to my blog. Besides I fixed some layout glitches, too. It looks much better now.
