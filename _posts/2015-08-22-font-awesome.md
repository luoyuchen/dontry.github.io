Today I tried to figure out how to use some pretty icon to show my contact at footer. Then I found [Font-awesome](http://fontawesome.dashgame.com/). It has a vast variety of useful website icons which is designed for Bootstrap. It is controlled by CSS that can create many amazing effects. It satifies all I need and make my site look nicer.
