Today I set up the music player and slide show modal for my blog. I generate the music player from [Netease Music](http://music.163.com). It's very easy, you could create an external link from an album. For carousel, it's kinda complicated and challenging. But with the help of [Jekyll tips](http://jekyll.tips/tutorials/photo-gallery/), I did accomplish it at last. I think I should better understand the Jekyll and Liquid.
