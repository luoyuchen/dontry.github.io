Functions can use objects to remember the results of previous operations, making it possible to avoid unnecessary work. This optimization is called memoization. JavaScriptâ€™s objects and arrays are very convenient for this.

In JavaScript we can  keep our momoized results in a memo array by using closure feature. When our function is called, it first looks to see if it already knows the result. If it does, it can immediately return it.

```javascript
    var fibonnaci = function(){
        var memo = [0, 1];
        var fib = function(n){
            var result = memo[n];
            if( typeof memo[n] !== 'number'){
                result = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
                memo[n] = result;
            }
            return result;
        }
        return fib;
    }();
```

This function substantially reduce the amount of work.

We can generalize this by making a function that helps us make memoized functions.

####The memoized function:
```javascript
    var memoizer = function(memo fundamental){
        var shell = function(n){
            var result = memo[n];
            if(typeof result !== 'number'){
                result = fundamental(shell, n);
                memo[n] = result;
            }
            return result;
        };
        return shell;
    };
```

Now we can define fibonacci with the memoizer:

```javascript
    var fibonacci = memoizer([0, 1], function(shell, n){
        return shell(n -1) + shell(n - 2);
        });
```

Besides, we can produce a memoizing factorial function:

```javascript
    var factorial  = memoizer([1,1], function(shell, n){
        return n * shell(n-1);
        });
```
